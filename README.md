# Welcome to my School Grading System! 
This is a command-line tool built using Python that utilizes object-oriented programming principles to help teachers and administrators manage student grades.

The tool is designed to be easy to use and understand, it allows teachers to input student grades and generate reports, such as class averages, student grades, and grade distributions.

##The tool allows teachers to: 

Add and remove students
Add and remove grades for students
Generate reports such as class averages, student grades, and grade distributions
Store data in a local file for later use
This tool is built using Python's built-in libraries such as csv, os and datetime to handle data input/output and it uses object-oriented programming principles to encapsulate the data and logic of the program.

This tool is particularly useful for small to medium-sized schools that don't have access to expensive grading software. It can also be used by teachers to keep track of their students' grades outside of the school's existing grading system.

I hope you find this tool to be useful and easy to use. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to hear your thoughts and work to improve the application.
